# Doorstop Testing

### Preview
A preview of the final output can be seen here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jonathanli15/t_miner_test/blob/main/Traceability_Report_doorstop.html

### Repository
This was report was created using this repository: https://github.com/jonathanli15/doorstop_test and the action run can be found in the action tab. The report analyzes the file main.py. This is a real world dataset forked from: https://github.com/doorstop-dev/doorstop. It was changed a little to meet our requirements, but still works very smoothly. The only issue is the forking of the repository created an issue with the url pattern, so the html does not link to the source and target files.
