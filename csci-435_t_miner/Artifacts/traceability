Traceability is a mechanism to uncovering implicit relationships among software artifacts such as connecting certain issues to specific code.

Current techniques are limited, as they only use one measure of similarity and arenâ€™t able to detect both implicit and explicit relationships


COMET overcomes these limitations, and is able to infer trace links
